This Python-based cybersecurity utility is designed to perform three essential tasks: network scanning, port scanning, and basic vulnerability assessment for directory traversal. This tool is ideal for ethical hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts looking to analyze and secure their networks.

Features ðŸ“‹
Network Scanning

Uses ARP requests to discover active devices within a specified IP range.
Retrieves IP and MAC addresses of connected devices.

Port Scanning

Leverages the Nmap library to perform comprehensive scans on all 65,535 ports of a target.
Displays open ports and associated services.
Example Output:
makefile
Copy code
Host: 192.168.1.1
State: up
Protocol: TCP
Port: 22/ssh
Port: 80/http
Directory Traversal Vulnerability Check

Tests web servers for directory traversal vulnerabilities by attempting to access sensitive files like /etc/passwd.
Example Output:
php
Copy code
Directory traversal vulnerability found at http://example.com/../../etc/passwd
No directory traversal vulnerability was found at http://example.com/
Getting Started ðŸš€
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python Libraries:
Install them using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install scapy python-nmap requests
Usage
Network Scanning
Scan a specified IP range to discover active devices.

Python
Copy code
clients = scan_network('192.168.1.0/24')
for a client in clients:
    print(f"IP: {client['ip']}, MAC: {client['mac']}")
Port Scanning
Could you perform a port scan on a specific target IP?

Python
Copy code
port_scan('192.168.1.1')
Directory Traversal Test
Check if a web server is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

python
Copy code
check_directory_traversal('http://example.com/')
Use Cases ðŸŽ¯
Identify devices and their MAC addresses on a network.
Assess open ports and running services for vulnerabilities.
Test web servers for directory traversal exploits.
